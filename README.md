# Food Status Effects

> Adds relevancy and status buffs to obscure foods

Concepts

- Glow Berries give glowing
- Chicken gives Slow falling
- Cookies give Speed (haste?)
- Spider Eye also gives night vision
- Mutton gives Resistance (Wool)
- Mushroom Stew gives instant health and regen (like SoupPvp)
- Beetroot Soup gives Strength (Beetroot found in Nether?)
- Cake rewards Haste (but (eventual?) slowness)

Framework:

- Sugars: Speed, Haste
- Vitamins & Veges: Regeneration
- Meat: Strength?
- Stew: Health
- Fats & Carbs: Resistance, Saturation, Slowness

Foods can be an early-game option for utility and convenience, but must not be a late-game substitute for potions.

Common consumables (only Cooked Beef, really) are left untouched. Since everyone only eats Cooked Beef, sometimes Golden Apples, this pack would not be an interference for like, 90% of players' playstyles. Then, if people don't like this tweak, they can just ignore it!
